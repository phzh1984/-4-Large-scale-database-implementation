This project is design and build a SQL Server database to store a real big data dataset. Develop a suitable database design, implement it in the SQL Server database, and document the design and implementation. Design, build, and populate the database.

Write a short report documenting the database design and implementation at a technical level.

This report includes the following, where applicable:

• An overview of the dataset

• A justification of SQL Server database with reference to the requirements and nature of the dataset.

• A discussion of the SQL Server database implementation, including details of its “schema”. Explain the reasoning behind my design decisions.

• A discussion of how to import the dataset into the database, highlighting the tools used, and any problems that arose and how I solved them.
